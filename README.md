# Rimfrost Kubernetes

Kubernetes deployment of Rimfrost PoC for VAH (Vård av husdjur)

Start it with `./deploy.sh`.
Clean it with `./cleanup.sh`.

## Port forwarding

Start with `./deploy.sh --pf` to trigger port forwarding to open port for accessing the VAH service

## Useful Commands

Check pod status:

```sh
kubectl get pods
```

View ingress proxy logs:

```sh
kubectl logs -f -n ingress-nginx deployment/ingress-nginx-controller
```

Open Kubernetes dashboard:

```sh
minikube dashboard
```

## Integration test

Run `mvn verify` to trigger integration tests.
This launches the kubernetes environment locally for testing, runs a smoke test and takes down the environment.

## Develop faster locally (quarkus projects)

Instead of relying on pushing your changes to GitHub and waiting for a workflow to build and publish a docker image, which takes extra time and effort, you can just do it locally.

1. Locate your project's `Dockerfile.jvm` file, usually located at `.\src\main\docker` from the root of the project. Make sure that the OpenJDK version in the `FROM` line matches your project's Java version to minimize build errors. For example, for Java 21 this version would most likely work:

    ```dockerfile
    registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/openjdk-21:latest
    ```

    For finding an image that works for your project, [this website](https://catalog.redhat.com/en/search?searchType=containers) is a good place to start.


2. Add support for building Docker images in your Quarkus project (if it does not already support it). In the root of your project, run the following:

    ```bash
    ./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="io.quarkus:quarkus-container-image-docker"
    ```


3. Build your local Docker image:

    ```bash
    ./mvnw -s settings.xml clean package \
      -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true \
      -Dquarkus.container-image.image=<image-name> \
      -Dquarkus.container-image.tag=<tag>
    ```

4. Load the Docker image into Minikube so it is available for use in your cluster (Minikube must be running for this to work):

    ```bash
    minikube image load <image-name>
    ```

5. Add your image to a new deployment/pod in the `values.yaml` of this repository:

    ```yaml
    - name: <valfritt-namn-på-podden>
      image:
        repository: <image-namn>
        tag: <tag>
      waitForKafka: true
    ```
